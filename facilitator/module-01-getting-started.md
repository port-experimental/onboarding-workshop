# Module 1: Getting Started - Facilitator Notes

## Workshop Delivery Guidance

**Pre-Workshop Setup (15 minutes)**
- Ensure all participants have Port access (trial accounts or demo environment)
- Verify everyone can access the Port interface
- Have backup demo credentials ready for technical issues

**Module Timing**
- **Presentation**: 10-15 minutes (concepts and overview)
- **Hands-On Exercise**: 15-20 minutes (guided navigation)
- **Q&A and Troubleshooting**: 5-10 minutes

**Key Teaching Points**
1. **Port is a Portal**: Emphasize that Port centralizes developer tools and information
2. **Navigation Patterns**: Show how consistent navigation works across all sections
3. **Builder vs User Views**: Distinguish between admin (Builder) and user interfaces
4. **TechCorp Context**: Explain that all examples use this fictional company

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Why do I see different data than the screenshots?"**  
A: Port instances vary based on integrations. Focus on the interface patterns, not specific data.

**Q: "Can I break anything by clicking around?"**  
A: No, the navigation exercises are safe. Builder section requires admin permissions to make changes.

**Q: "What if I don't see the same menu options?"**  
A: Permissions may vary. Focus on the sections you can access - the concepts remain the same.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Can't access Port | Check login credentials, try incognito mode |
| Missing menu items | Verify user permissions, may need admin access |
| Interface looks different | Port UI updates regularly, focus on core concepts |
| Slow loading | Check internet connection, try refreshing |

## Extension Activities

**For Fast Learners:**
- Explore entity relationships in the catalog
- Try creating a simple widget on the Home page
- Look at existing action configurations in Self-Service

**For Groups:**
- Have participants share what they find most interesting
- Discuss how Port might fit into their current workflows
- Compare Port's approach to other tools they use

## Assessment Checkpoints

Ensure participants can demonstrate:
- [ ] Navigate between all four main sections
- [ ] Explain the difference between Catalog pages and Dashboard pages
- [ ] Locate the Builder credentials section
- [ ] Identify where to add widgets to dashboards
