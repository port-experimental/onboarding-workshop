2. **[Blueprints](../modules/02-blueprints/)** (15 min)
   - Focus on the GitHub Release blueprint exercise
   - Understand properties, relationships, and meta properties

3. **[Data Sources](../modules/03-data-sources/)** (15 min)
   - Complete the GitHub integration mapping
   - Understand JQ basics and data transformation

### Phase 2: Practical Application (60-90 minutes)
**Build something useful**

4. **[Dashboards](../modules/04-dashboards/)** (30 min)
   - Create one comprehensive dashboard
   - Focus on table and chart widgets
   - Skip advanced customization

5. **[Actions](../modules/05-actions/)** (45 min)
   - Create the deployment action exercise
   - Understand payload templating
   - Skip complex approval workflows

6. **[Scorecards](../modules/06-scorecards/)** (15 min)
   - Create one simple scorecard
   - Understand level logic
   - Skip advanced rule patterns

### Phase 3: Next Steps (30 minutes)
**Plan your implementation**

7. **[Terraform](../modules/07-terraform/)** (30 min)
   - Understand infrastructure-as-code benefits
   - Set up basic provider configuration
   - Skip complex CI/CD setup

## Quick Start Challenges

Focus on these high-impact challenges:

### Essential Challenges (30 minutes)
- [Create Your First Blueprint](../challenges/beginner/first-blueprint.md) (15 min)
- [Build a Simple Dashboard](../challenges/beginner/simple-dashboard.md) (15 min)

### Optional Challenges (if time permits)
- [Create a Self-Service Action](../challenges/intermediate/simple-action.md) (20 min)

## Key Takeaways for Quick Start

- **Port is a Developer Portal**: Centralized place for all development resources
- **Blueprints Define Structure**: Think database schema for your software catalog
- **Integrations Populate Data**: Automatic data ingestion from GitHub, CI/CD, etc.
- **Self-Service Reduces Friction**: Developers can do more without waiting
- **Quality is Measurable**: Scorecards provide objective quality metrics

## Implementation Checklist

After this quick start, you should be able to:

- [ ] Explain Port's value to stakeholders
- [ ] Design basic blueprints for your organization
- [ ] Configure GitHub integration for your repositories
- [ ] Create dashboards for team visibility
- [ ] Build simple self-service actions
- [ ] Plan a Port rollout strategy

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Assess Your Needs**: What problems could Port solve for your team?
2. **Inventory Your Tools**: What systems would you integrate with Port?
3. **Identify Champions**: Who would help drive Port adoption?

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. **Pilot Implementation**: Start with one team or use case
2. **Gather Feedback**: What works well? What needs improvement?
3. **Expand Gradually**: Add more teams and use cases

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
1. **Organization-Wide Rollout**: Scale to all development teams
2. **Advanced Features**: Implement complex workflows and integrations
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization

## Quick Reference Card

### Port Navigation
- **Home**: Personal dashboard
- **Catalog**: Browse all entities
- **Self-Service**: Available actions
- **Builder**: Admin configuration

### Key Concepts
- **Blueprint**: Data model template
- **Entity**: Specific instance of a blueprint
- **Integration**: Connection to external system
- **Action**: Self-service workflow
- **Scorecard**: Quality measurement framework

### Common Tasks
- Create blueprint: Builder → Data Model → + Blueprint
- Add integration: Builder → Data Sources → Edit
- Build dashboard: Catalog → + New → Dashboard Page
- Create action: Self-Service → + Action
